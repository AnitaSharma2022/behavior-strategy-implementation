## Before this Module

In the previous module ([debugging](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/debugging), 2 weeks) students learned covered the basics of JS as an imperative programming language (variables, primitive types, operators & coercion, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays and objects).

They also learned how to step through code using the debugger and [JS Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/live.html#mode=edit), how to reverse-engineer simple I/O programs with prompt/alert/confirm, and how to do assertion testing with `console.assert`.

# Solution Write-Ups

> [solution write-ups](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/solution-write-ups) - analyze other people's solutions to code challenges

The main objective of these exercises is practicing how to learn from code, to be given source code you don't understand and to study it until you could write it yourself.

You will build your personal library of challenges, solutions and clever tricks by investigating how other people have solved challenges on popular coding sites.

You don't need to use branches, or issues, or project boards, or anything like that. This is an individual exercise for you to focus on coding, so do whatever works for you.

Don't worry about passing linting checks for this exercise, other people's solutions will have all sorts of code and you are encouraged to experiment with everything JS has to offer, and with every crazy idea you have to solve the challenges. **Solution Write-Ups** is about exploration and creativity, **Practice Code Review** is about writing the cleanest solutions possible,

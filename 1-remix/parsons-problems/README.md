## Parsons Problems

Study many different ways to approach the same problem by reconstructing different solutions. (most of) The exercises in this folder are organized like so:

- **one folder per behavior**: The top-level folders all contain solutions to the same coding challenge
  - **one folder per strategy**: Folders inside each coding challenge have a different strategy
    - **one .js file per implementation**: Each parsons problem has a different implementation for the same strategy

Keep an eye out for side-effects! Many of the solutions from CodeWars will modify the arrays that are passed as arguments, can you spot which ones?

_Hint: start with [./repeat-string](./repeat-string), it's adapted from the examples in this module's README. All the others are adapted from CodeWars_

> Psst. There's a lot of these, you don't need to do them all! Just as much as you find helpful
